# Password Manager

This is a Python application developed for storing passwords and usernames with a graphical user interface (GUI). The software creates two files for you: one named `key.key`, which is your decryption key, and the other named `password.txt`, where your encrypted passwords are stored. Please make sure to securely manage and maintain these two files.
